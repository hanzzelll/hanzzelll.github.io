          <p>
            I am Hannah C. Perona, and I am currently a 2nd-year college student at the Laguna State Polytechnic University San Pablo Campus. I am taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am the middle child, and I have two siblings. I took this program because I wanted to explore my knowledge about technology because, ever since I was a child, I have been really interested in computers. My hobbies are singing and watching movies or series.
